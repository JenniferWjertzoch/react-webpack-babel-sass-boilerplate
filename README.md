# React boilerplate including Webpack, Babel and Sass

## Overview
Here I will show how to create a basic React application inclusing all node dependencies, Webpack and Babel. I will also show how to add Sass (SCSS) using global styles and component styles using CSS modules.

For this boilerplate, I used:
* React
* Node
* Webpack
* Sass

## Why this boilerplate
With every new project I would be repeating myself. That can introduce inconsistencies in how a project is set up. This can cause confusion.

This is where boilerplates come in. A boilerplate is a template that I can clone and reuse for every project.


## Run project
### run in production mode
Generate the dist files and then start server at port 3000

` $ npm run build`

` $ npm run start`
